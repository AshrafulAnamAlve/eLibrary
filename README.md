# 📚 eLibrary – Library Management System

A complete **Library Management System** built using **ASP.NET Core Web API**, **Angular**, and **SQL Server**.  
This system allows **users** to register, borrow books, and manage their orders, while **admins** can manage users, books, and monitor all library operations.  
JWT authentication ensures secure login and role-based access.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
The **eLibrary** system digitalizes the entire book borrowing and returning process.  
Users can order books after admin approval, and admins can track, approve, or block users as needed.

Fine and blocking mechanisms are automated:
- If a book is not returned within **10 days**, a fine of **৳50 per day** applies.
- When the fine reaches **৳500**, the user account gets **automatically blocked**.

## 🔐 Authentication System
- Secure login using **JWT tokens**.
- Admin approval required before a new user can log in.
- Role-based access control ensures separate views and privileges for Admins and Users.

---

## 💡 Fine System Logic
- User must return the book within **10 days**.
- If late:
  - `Fine = Days Late × 50`
- If fine ≥ 500:
  - Account automatically **blocked**.
- Users can view and pay fines from their dashboard.
